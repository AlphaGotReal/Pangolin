Pangolin 2 Goals
* "Matplotlib for real-time computer vision"
* Enable simpler visual debugging and advanced visualization
* Minimize boilerplate and maximize readability
* Minimize GUI investment cost for rapid iteration
* Graphics backed agnostic API
* Sensible defaults for everything, so a user who doesn't care can get going immediately.
* Strict treatment of axis and image coordinate conventions for precise rendering
* Support 'getting to metal' for people who need tight control over graphics library or
  specific interop with it (such as CUDA)
